the file paths can be a string of the file's location locally
every img and mp3 will be local

if the user uploads a file it will be saved on the users machine
we have to check if the file path's in the database exist on the users machine every reload

1. check if the file path from the database is in the "files" folder
2. if not in the "files" folder, delete from the database
